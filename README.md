## Plugins in Detail

### hermes-tweet

Read-first X/Twitter research and approval-gated publishing workflows through Xquik.

Use it for public thread analysis, account research, search summaries, monitoring reports, and draft-first publishing workflows.

[Full installation instructions](./plugins/hermes-tweet/README.md)

### vtsls-lsp

TypeScript and JavaScript language intelligence for Claude Code, powered by [VTSLS](https://github.com/yioneko/vtsls) — the same TypeScript engine that powers VS Code.

Gives Claude Code's built-in `LSP` tool access to go-to-definition, find references, hover types, document symbols, workspace symbol search, go-to-implementation, and call hierarchy — for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, and ESM/CJS variants.

**Why VTSLS over `typescript-language-server`?** VTSLS uses VS Code's TypeScript extension under the hood. It handles complex projects — monorepos, path aliases, project references — more reliably than the alternative.

### oxlint-hook

Auto-lints JS/TS files as Claude edits them. After each write, it runs `oxlint --fix` to clean up fixable violations in place, then reports anything left to Claude as a system message so Claude can address it in the next turn.

Works with your project's existing `.oxlintrc.json` — no extra config needed in the plugin. Prefers the local `node_modules/.bin/oxlint` binary so it always uses the version your project specifies.

### secret-scan-hook

Protects against leaked secrets in two layers. The async per-file scan warns Claude immediately after each write so secrets get caught early. The blocking commit gate intercepts `git commit` commands and hard-blocks any commit where staged files contain secrets — using [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) with 140+ detectors covering AWS, GitHub, Stripe, GCP, and more.

Respects `.gitleaks.toml` at the project root for custom rules and allowlists.
